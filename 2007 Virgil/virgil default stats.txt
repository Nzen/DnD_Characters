
Cleric but maybe multiclass with rogue by background, I don't care
I am son of an indentured farmer but fourth child, so partly neglected. Urchin gang becomes delinquent gang but split by adult rivals. I joined a group of highwaymen for a time, but we unsuccessfully raided an evil wizard's lair. I was captured and made a slave until the wizard was deposed by a local parish. I pined for the female cleric who rescued me so I joined and trained to become a cleric. I took to the religion itself though, as redemption (like My Name is Earl).

you may only prepare a certain amount each day, but you know all of them. Up to second level spells as spells go, clerics automatically know all of their sells and you can cast 4 level one spells, 3 level two spells, and 2 level three spells a day. I'd pick a few you know you'll prepare often so that you don't have to check the book as often each day.

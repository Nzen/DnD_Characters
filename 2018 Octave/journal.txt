Joined dwarn scouts to find Angela's character, but ostensibly for cash. Met up with Jeff and Ashley aver they'd assassinated general on USA-independence style battle. We infiltrated the mine they'd contracted (of the country I'm from) and killed the only two guards (who apparently were just for preventing theft and union activity).

Next time, we'll have a quarantine notice sent to the dwarves. I'm not sure if the unfavorable mining contract is enough for me to turn on the dwarves.

Inclined to try a gal. Very likely human again. Inclined to fight (nur, they all fight and they all have magic to some degrease).  Maybe ranger or rogue.

Looked at the backgrounds. Noble looks interesting. Nobless oblige, kindness, generosity. The bonds are weird. The most likely is 'I do anything to preserve our family's alliance with X family'. The flaws all suck, because they're flaws. (Flaws are also sort of weird because they work against party cohesion. I've watched shows where the ensemble always got along and just fought the outside only ever.) I'm inclined to use dark secret and generate family shame. Maybe no longer fecund because of an illness or injury, so they spurned me somewhat, so I turned to forestry and rangerhood. What if the other family is giants, which is why I know them so well? But they're fundamentally ambivalent about the town. Base of mountain, foothills mining whatever. [maybe like glinda from g s's wicked]

what makes families feel shame? unable to keep alliance, affairs, addiction, misspent money, misspent secrets, intra family violence and disagreements, disrespecting a higher status individual / organization, deformity, outsize emotional responses

as with shadowrun, much of this depends on the then context, like is this 50s whoa post war or 70s war is over there, or even 00s like what is war even; which is all modern, it's more like is this 400s mass migrations or 1200s european feudalism round fifty; what's the area and political situation, and the answer is, we'll riff it out, as we probably aren't using forgotten realms or something established like that. probably.

I hear this may be like late 1500s columbian exchange whoa domination, or maybe african style stuff? So, I'd have to actually be dominican for my family not to be way away, which sort of sucks narratively but it's "freeing" in the sense of "no one can ever put me in a devil's bargin because they're all safe at home" unless of course my brother secretly stowed away (but that's less likely given that he's adopted the vacuum I left in our family)

for ranger, I'm sort of thinking the border warden from brightness reef. not that it means much, given he's just walking around being aware and dancing the arrest of the gal and psychic / hallucinating the mulespider. brightness reef has some cool elements for when if I dm, like I'd replace dwarves with the qheuens (pentagonal crabs) um elves with Ur-ronn, maybe g'Keks are gnomes?, maybe orcs are hoon, humans are, and nothing can be traeki they're um beholders? Which is all cool, but way apart from the point of what he's not aragorn

is she like jane goodall? maybe. except the giant relationship preexisted her or maybe her family established it in the last couple of generations which let them finally get at these mountains with veins of whatever or fey lines or whatever, what if they used a belt of giant strength to get on equal terms and she lost it? maybe, or maybe she's involved with the disappearence of one of their members, prominent obviously otherwise who cares (well, it could be an unsteady alliance, they don't have to be royal cloud giants) what if it's an exchange like wulfenbach arranged? and the family had resisted until she did her whatever or experienced whatever

inclined to refer to world of darkness about vices and stuff, as that's their reason d etre

the world can be termed dystopic because there's healing, so pain is cheap, but only if you're rich; naw, the priests probably have a quota of poor / lay people that they dispensate to and it's not like every town has a resurrection capable bishop or whatever

it's funny that I'm driving myself to two setbacks, basically, one to get her fully with the giants and one to get her away from the giants into the party's story. well, it's not like she needs to be shunned to go to visit the giants, she could just be not whoa next lady of the ruddy hamlet, you know, the lady is her aunt or whatever, then she's not striving to goodall out of grief or trauma or whatever so much as maybe ambition; but then she has to get back to the castle or whatever / goodall returned for supplies and bs certainly\ and lose them the item. what if it's not just the dmGuide belt, but a more powerful one that is like maybe a little cursed yay; and then when she exchanges it for magic beans, her adventure begins as she goes out to get it back before the giants hold their tournament or whatever for her cousin's wedding

you think glinda would do this? glinda is way less a priority than this now, though that helps I guess, to guide small interactions. magic beans is nice, loosten my girdle is nice, let me just study it i'm a vvisard jk rogue heres a fake back is nice; so that's what gets me out? yeah, I was just already knight ranger goodall with the giants to help with my side rather than whatever go merchant or overseer for our bit

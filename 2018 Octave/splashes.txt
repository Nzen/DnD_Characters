Inclined to try a gal. Very likely human again. Inclined to fight (nur, they all fight and they all have magic to some degrease).  Maybe ranger or rogue.

Looked at the backgrounds. Noble looks interesting. Nobless oblige, kindness, generosity. The bonds are weird. The most likely is 'I do anything to preserve our family's alliance with X family'. The flaws all suck, because they're flaws. (Flaws are also sort of weird because they work against party cohesion. I've watched shows where the ensemble always got along and just fought the outside only ever.) I'm inclined to use dark secret and generate family shame. Maybe no longer fecund because of an illness or injury, so they spurned me somewhat, so I turned to forestry and rangerhood. What if the other family is giants, which is why I know them so well? But they're fundamentally ambivalent about the town. Base of mountain, foothills mining whatever. [maybe like glinda from g s's wicked]

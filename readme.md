### Dungeons & Dragons Characters

Basically, I made this to track my current D&D character. But, I have these old writings I can embarass myself with and fill out the repository with so it isn't as though I made a whole project to track & share three files. Anyway,

Each folder has documentation of a particular character I role played during a D&D campaign. They corresspond to 3rd, 3.5, 4th, and 5th edition characters. Only the files in '2015 Yamluke' are written for public display. The others were predominantly meditations on that character's motivation and background.
